## 4. Bugs & Issues

### Bug Report 1

**Title**: The System accepts duplicated schedule

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1.	Go to the CleanCity Portal
2.	Request waste pickup with the same time twice
3.	Submit Request
4.	Go to the Admin portal
5.	Look for the orders if there is a duplicate


**Expected**: System should not accept a duplicate waste pickup

**Actual**: There is a duplicate of a schedule pickup

**Severity**: High

Issue Link: https://github.com/dlulanep/PLP-Database-DEPT-CleanCity/issues/1


Bug Report 2

**Title**: Accessibility Bug – Missing alt Attributes on Images

**Description**:
During manual accessibility testing, several images were found without alt attributes, which makes them unreadable by screen readers and violates WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

Open the website in Google Chrome.

Right-click > Inspect → DevTools.

Go to the "Issues" tab.

**Observe**: Multiple warnings about missing alt attributes.

**Expected Result**:
All meaningful images should have descriptive alt attributes.

**Actual Result**:
Several images are missing alt attributes.

**Severity**:
Medium – Affects screen reader users and may reduce the accessibility compliance of the site.

Recommendation:
Add appropriate alt text for all images or use alt="" for decorative ones.

Severity: Medium
Status: Open

Bug Report 3

**Title**: Functional Bug – Form Accepts Past and Blank Dates

**Description**:
During manual UI testing on the Netlify-deployed form, it was found that the system allows users to submit a form with either:

A date in the past (e.g., 30/06/2025)

No date input at all (blank date field)

This undermines the expected validation behavior, especially when future dates are required for the form's purpose (e.g., scheduling or planning).

**Steps to Reproduce**:

Open the form in any modern browser (e.g., Google Chrome).

Scroll to the date input field.

Enter a past date (e.g., 01/07/2025) or leave the field blank.

Click the Submit button.

**Expected Result**:

The form should prevent submission and display a validation error when the date is in the past or when left empty.

**Actual Result**:

The form accepts both past dates and blank fields, allowing incomplete or invalid data to be submitted.

**Severity**:
Medium – This can lead to incorrect data records and scheduling conflicts.

Status:
Open

## 5. Recommendations

- Add more unit tests for form validation and business logic in `script.js`.
- Consider automated end-to-end tests (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) for UI flows.
- Improve error handling for network failures.

To improve accessibility and comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards:

- Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes that convey the meaning or purpose of the image. This allows screen readers to interpret the content for visually impaired users and improves usability for all users relying on assistive technologies.

Additionally:

- Decorative images can use alt="" to avoid cluttering screen reader output.

- For icons used as buttons or links, ensure they have aria-labels or text equivalents.

- Run Lighthouse and axe DevTools regularly to catch accessibility regressions.

- Add client-side and server-side validation to ensure the date field:

- Does not accept dates earlier than the current date.

- Is marked as a required field.

- Consider using HTML5 attributes like required and min on the date input, backed by logic validation in JavaScript or backend code.
